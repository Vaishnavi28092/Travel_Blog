    <h3>Mountain Climbing</h3>
    <p>Mountain climbing forms one of the most popular sports in the genre of adventure sports. It is a game that involves hiking up a mountain that gives the climber 
    a lot of adventure and fun. It strengthens one’s muscles, boosts the stamina and also provides the added advantage of observing exotic views from the mountain top.

This adventure sport is fun but at the same time quite risky. It looks effortless from a distance, but it poses numerous challenges to the climber. There are people
 from various places who enjoy this thrill, and according to them, the more incredible the mountains, the greater the thrill for them.
Mountain climbing is by its nature risky; it can be quite dangerous unless climbers are properly trained. Climbers test their skills, strength, balance, resourcefulness,

        <h3>My Goa Trip</h3>
        <p>Recently I have visited goa with my family. I would love to share my trip experience. One must visit goa in moonsoon season for greenery, cool weather. 
            Sometimes it is raining and again suddenly stops and rain. We had fun time. North goa has many places to visit compare to south goa. But still both places 
            offers fun.Most of the beaches we have visited. More than temples and churches.The only thing keep in mind is if someone want to come goa for waterrides at
            beaches then a big NO to them in moonsoon season. Since there is no water ride activities happen at beaches in rainy season. It is strictly restricted by 
            tourism. Forts and jungle trips on your own risk.Transportation mode is good, bus and autos are budget transport mode, taxis are bit expensive.
            Food is awesome both veg and sea food.Shopping is not much and again need to mention, open markets are closed during moonsoon season which is july-September 
            end.Everywhere bargaining is important whether it is hotel accomodation or shopping.Overall it is relaxed fun trip. Great scenic with greenary and river
             trips are awesome to visit goa. You will feel refreshed after goa visit. Goa is one of the most attractive places to visit in India. This small state is 
             famous for its beautiful beaches and has many other tourist attractions like forts, spice plantations, and museums.Many Bollywood movies like Dil Chahta Hai,
            Hasina Maan Jayegi, Golmaal, Singham, Rangeela, Jalwa, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa etc. were shot here. Goa's primary revenue comes from the tourism industry and due
             to this fact, Goa is now one of the fastest developing states in terms .We stayed in "Renzos Inn" hotel, near to Calangute beach, North Goa. The hotel had
            very good room service. Hostel staff was very nice and supportive. They provided us local vehicle facility at affordable rates. We do not have any complaints
             regarding our stay at the hotel. The hotel itself is very clean and well maintained.On the second day, we visited Dona Paula beach and the shooting location
            where part of the shooting of the film "Singham" took place.we enjoyed the water sports and related rides at Calangute beach. The rides were full of
             excitement and it was first in a lifetime experience. After water rides and sports, we went to Aguada Fort where the Hindi Movie "Dil Chahta Hai" was shot.
            We enjoyed the sunset at Sinquerim beach near to the Aguada Fort.</p>
